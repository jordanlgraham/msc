# Insert

Insert is a utility that makes inserting images and links to files into the
body field and other WYSIWYG editors or text areas much easier by adding a
simple JavaScript-based button and optional controls to file and image fields.
Images may be inserted using any image style preset. Insert may also be
interfaced to by other modules for inserting custom content.
